# FDTR_DataAnalysis

This python file uses a multilayer matrix approach to solving for unknown parameters by fitting to standard frequency-domain thermoreflectance data.

The file is commented to allow the user to fit to any unknown parameters in a standard material stack. This analysis was built using information from the following sources:

(1) Schmidt, A.J., Cheaito, R. and Chiesa, M., 2009. A frequency-domain thermoreflectance method for the characterization of thermal properties. Review of scientific instruments, 80(9), p.094901.
